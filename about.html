<h2>About Us</h2>
<div class="about-content">
Home Rental is a leading, online search engine for rental housing. Founded in 2019, the site was developed in response to a gap in the market: there was no simple, pain-free way of finding all rental housing listings in one spot. Home Rental set out to fix this, making it our mission to help apartment hunters and managers navigate through the online "jungle" of rental housing and finally get connected easily.

Searching for Rental properties:
Homerental.com is our answer to the problem of easily finding a place to rent. It makes searching for rental housing as easy as using booking.com for travel deals and bdjobs.com to find jobs. We pull listings from over 12,000 property management and owner websites and add them to our search database on a nightly basis. At any given time, we have anywhere from 700,000 to 1 million active listings - that's more than any other site.
Furthermore, we developed our website to be a complete decision-making resource. We list profiles for every neighborhood in the country so you can decide if it's a place you want to live. You can search by map or through lists. You can filter your search by property features and amenities. And once you find a listing you're interested in, you can go directly to the property's site to make inquiries.
So, if you're ready to see just about every available apartment, townhouse, condo and single or multifamily rental property out there, you've found the right search engine. Welcome to Home Rental, The Housing Search Engine.
